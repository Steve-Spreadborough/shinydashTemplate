## Details

This is a project used to develop functionality for Shiny Apps in a single place
which can then be used as a template for creating actual Apps from. The idea
therefore being that everything in this project should be reproducible and
easy to copy/replicate to other Shiny Apps to support creating and rolling out
'production' apps with similar layouts/functionality.. 

This project is very much developmental and reflects authors development of code
and knowledge around Shiny. Contributions and suggestions on improving code, 
following the code of conduct, are welcome.

The layout of code follows the use of modules & R6 Class object for sharing data
between modules within a `{golem}` framework. See 
[here](https://engineering-shiny.org/index.html) re creating production grade 
shiny apps with `{golem}` and 
[here](https://engineering-shiny.org/common-app-caveats.html?q=R6#using-r6-as-data-storage)
re using R6 class objects for data storage.

**Important**: This app uses data from the `stats19` package, 
[here](https://github.com/ropensci/stats19), containing crash data. The app uses
this data purely as example data and the outputs including in this graph are
for demonstration/exploration of code purposes only.

As a basic, this application includes the following set up:

- Code structure following `{golem}`
- Shiny dashboard layout using `shinydashboardPlus`
- Modules with UIs & servers
- R6 class objects for data storage and access across modules
- Reactivity of R6 objects using `gargoyle`
- Util functions used across the App
- Unit testing

See NEWS for further developments. 



## Run

You can launch the application by running:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::load_all()
shinyTemplate::run_app()
```

## About

You are reading the doc about version : `r golem::pkg_version()`

This README has been compiled on the

```{r}
Sys.time()
```

Here are the tests results and package coverage:

```{r, error = TRUE}
devtools::check(quiet = TRUE)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
unloadNamespace("shinyTemplate")
```

```{r, error = TRUE}
covr::package_coverage()
```
